# ML From Scratch

Machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch,
using Python for clarity and C++ for core computations.

## Goals
- Understand machine learning algorithms from first principles
- Implement core models without relying on high-level libraries
- Explore performance-oriented components in C/C++

## Status
Work in progress.
